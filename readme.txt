This is an Xmpp client project.
*******************************

It is built on the Strophe.js library.

It also uses jQuery, jQueryUI and jStorage.

I have included a number of Strophe enhancements and fixes. The main one is support 
for both BOSH & WebSockets details of which can be found here: https://github.com/metajack/strophejs/pull/95

The client currently supports basic chat and parts of muc (XEP-0045).
