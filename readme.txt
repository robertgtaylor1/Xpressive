This is an Xmpp client project.
*******************************

It is built on the Strophe.js library.

It also uses jQuery, jQueryUI and jStorage.

I have included a number of Strophe enhancements and fixes. The main one is support 
for both BOSH & WebSockets details of which can be found here: https://github.com/metajack/strophejs/pull/95

The client currently supports:

	Basic chat
	XEP-0045	muc (partial)
	XEP-0004	xData Forms
	XEP-0030	Service Discovery
